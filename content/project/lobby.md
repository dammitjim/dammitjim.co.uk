A Twitch stream browser for the desktop!

This project was used to learn electron and was built using React / Redux, it was a lot of fun and I would one day like to return to it.

Used a [golang microservice](https://github.com/jimah/Lobby-Reception) as a middleman to authenticate and cache twitch request / responses.
