Hello! I'm a Web Developer or Software Engineer depending on who you ask. I've worked professionally as a programmer for three years, using a variety of tools and languages across that time. I would consider my main languages to be Python, Golang and <em>just enough Javascript</em><!--more-->

I currently specialise in Golang, developing high performance microservices for [Fresh8 Gaming](http://fresh8gaming.com/), an advertising startup based in Bristol and London, UK. Outside of work I'm usually cooking up a new idea or two, it's my goal to eventually run my own sustainable digital business to support myself and my family.

If you'd like to reach out, your best bet would be either via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thisisjimah) or [Email](jim@dammitjim.co.uk). I have a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jim-hill) but don't engage much with it, it's mostly there for recruiters to spam me with .NET jobs.
