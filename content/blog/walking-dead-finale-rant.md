Warning: this blog post is mostly venting about AMC’s The Walking Dead. <!--more-->

I needed to write this down.

I am a long term fan of the Walking Dead franchise, originally binge reading the comics and later watching the TV series. It’s a series that, for better or worse, I care a lot about.

It is also one of the most divisive adaptions of source material I have seen to date, unlike similar franchises such as Game of Thrones, the TV series and comics for TWD should be seen as completely separate entities. The fate of the characters is substantially different between the two, as is the writing. For me this leads to the traditional “it was better in the comics” commentary, hooray I get to be that guy for this series.

Well, _that guy_ is pretty annoyed with how the most recent series ended.

Without spoiling specifics, a major character dies in a particularly brutal and symbolic way in issue 100 of the comics. The scene is shocking and sets the tone for the following arc of the story, many people call it one of the most iconic points of the series and fans have been eager to see it adapted for television.

After a season of “who’s gonna die?” teases both within the show and out, our answer was… nothing. It was a cliffhanger, dammit.

I am not unfamiliar with the art of the cliffhanger either, I watched Lost week to week for the entirety of that show’s life. The season finale where they revealed the hatch is one of the high points of television for me as I spent that summer wondering what on earth was inside, cliffhangers can be executed well. They can also be executed disastrously badly, as is the case here. You cannot tease your fans for an entire season, promising that somebody is going to die, only to blue ball them in an iconic moment and expect everything to be okay. As a viewer it felt cheap, unearned and left a bad taste in my mouth.

There will be no catharsis, any weight the moment had will be missing the buildup they went through so many lengths to maintain. The next series has been confirmed to open immediately where it left off, whether or not this was a knee jerk reaction to fan outrage is suspect when you combine it with each actor claiming they don’t know who has died. If you were a production company shooting that scene, would you go through the trouble of setting it all up twice rather than shooting it all at once?

The finale was especially painful as Jeffery Dean Morgan’s portrayal of the next big bad was everything the fans dreamed it to be. But instead of this episode being remembered for his performance, it will be forgotten and overshadowed by the next season’s opening episode where people actually get what they want. We should have spent the season break wondering how on earth the crew are going to deal with this new, terrifying menace. The show has shown in the past season that it still has chops despite the zombies no longer being as much of a threat, I truly believe they could have pulled this off.

I’m not the only one annoyed by this, the internet was afoul with rage after the show ended with many publications writing scathing reviews. The cherry on top is the fact that the show runners knew exactly what they were doing.

I think it's time for me to stop treating the adaption as serious and join the rest of the crowd who are joking that we will be able to vote on who dies through Facebook. Or that the character managed to roll underneath another dumpster.

Well, at least the comics are still good.
